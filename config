# Required readable ACME account key
AccountKeyFile = account.key

# Required readable CSR file
CSRFile = domain.csr

# Optional ACME directory url
# Staging: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
ACMEDirectory = https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory

# Optional To be able to be reached by ACME provider (e.g. to warn about
# certificate expicration), you can provide some contact informations.
# Contacts setting is a list of contact URI separated by semicolon (;).
# If ACME provider support contact informations, it must at least support mailto
# URI and can support more of contact.
# For the mailto URI, the email address part must contains only one address
# without header fields (see [RFC6068]).
# Default: none
Contacts = mailto:yourmail@yourdomain.com

# Optional to give hint to the ACME server about your prefered language for errors given by their server
# See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language for more informations
# Default: en
#Language = en

# Optional: ask to request different format of certificate file.
# By default, acme-dns-tiny request a certificate chain with format
# "application/pem-certificate-chain"
# With this format, you can assume the first certificate block is the one for
# your domains, as the ACME RFC force the format to have this certificate first.
#
# If the ACME server support different format, you can specify it here
# (e.g. application/pkix-cert, applicaiton/pkcs7-mime)
# Note that, if the format selected doesn't provide a full chain, you should
# read logs to find the related certificates (see link header with attribute rel=up)
#CertificateFormat = application/pem-certificate-chain
